# **AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System**  

## **Overview**  
This project leverages machine learning to enhance medical diagnosis by analyzing patient symptoms, medical history, and lab results. Using AI-driven models, it aims to reduce misdiagnosis risks, minimize diagnostic delays, and assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions. The system is deployed as a web-based application using **Streamlit Cloud** for accessibility and ease of use.  

## **Problem Statement**  
The increasing complexity of diseases, vast amounts of patient data, and time constraints in medical settings often lead to human errors and delays in diagnosis. This project addresses these challenges by utilizing AI to process and interpret medical data quickly and accurately, supporting doctors in high-pressure environments.  

## **Features**  
✅ AI-powered analysis of patient data  
✅ Supports early detection of diseases (diabetes, thyroid disorders, lung cancer, Parkinson’s)  
✅ Machine learning models: **SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest**  
✅ Framework: **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**  
✅ Web-based UI using **Streamlit**  
✅ Deployment on **Streamlit Cloud**  

## **Project Workflow**  
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Gathering medical datasets, cleaning, and preparing for model training  
2️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation** – Training AI models and assessing accuracy
